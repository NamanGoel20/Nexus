## Description

- This React application is built using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
- It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- The application is generated in JavaScript.

## Pre-requisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - v16 or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - v6 or greater

## Running in dev environment
1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm start`

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:
- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.jsx` is the JavaScript entry point.
You may create subdirectories inside src.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## Installing a Dependency
You can install any dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:
```sh
npm install --save react-router
```
Alternatively you may use `yarn`:
```sh
yarn add react-router
```
